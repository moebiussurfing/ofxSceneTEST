## Description
This addon can draw a scene with two independent layers (don't do the mix!) of these 'draw types' enabled:

- image 1 (background)
- image 2
- letters (text) [two selectable colors and black and white mode]
- video (requires ofxHapPlayer and enable the #define)

There are some key commands:

- 's': show/hide GUI
- 'b': toggle two-colors/b&w modes
- 'r': toggle timer randomizer of the two colors.
